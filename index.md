## VScode Installation Guide 
The first thing we want to do is install the text editor VScode. Head to [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Pick the download based on your computer's os. For me its windows, but for you it might be Linux or OSX.

Once you have installed the VScode setup from their website, open it and complete the setup.

I am not using default themes, so yours might look slightly different than mine, but when you first open you should get a "get started" tab. 

## Remote Connection + git installation 
**if you are on Linux or OSX you can skip the git installation**
